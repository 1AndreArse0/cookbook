Miscellaneous IPython notebooks about chemical physics and science teaching.

This repository aims to show examples of python source code applied mainly to 
chemical physics and material science.
Some of them are used for teaching python or basic mathematical concepts.

The [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) extend the python 
interactive shell IPython as an interactive computational environment, in 
which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich 
media.

The IPython Notebooks present in this repository required the following python 
modules :

* [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org/) (Python Materials Genomics) A robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis.
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/) A platform for publishing beautiful, interactive graphs from Python to the web.

All notebooks can be read through the notebook viewver of github or on 
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/. The notebook of this repository can be found 
here : http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gvallverdu/cookbook.

## List of notebook

This is a brief description of notebooks :

plotly_bandDiagram
    Plot a band diagram with plotly and pymatgen libraries with a colorscale in
    order to highlight s and p contributions to a band or to the DOS.

gaussian_pymatgen
    How to use the pymatgen library in order to manage Gaussian input/output
    files.
