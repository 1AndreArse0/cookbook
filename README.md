Miscellaneous IPython notebooks about chemical physics and science teaching.

This repository aims to show examples of python source code applied mainly to chemical physics and material science.
Some of them are used for teaching python or basic mathematical concepts.

The [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) extend the python interactive shell IPython as an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media.

The IPython Notebooks present in this repository required the following python modules :

* [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org/) (Python Materials Genomics) A robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis.
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/) A platform for publishing beautiful, interactive graphs from Python to the web.
